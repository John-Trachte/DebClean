# DebClean
### Bash script to clear out excess caches, logs, and Snaps on Ubuntu installations
## Please read through the code before use and create backups of important files

This script should work with Ubuntu, PopOS, and other Debian-based distributions. It has only been tested on my Ubuntu installations.
